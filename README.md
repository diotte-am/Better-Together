# Better Together: Mental Health Support App

## <i>Team Work Makes Serene Work</i>

### Proposal
The mental health support app project began with a clear objective: to create an application catering to working adults, enabling them to track mood, formulate self-maintenance plans, and connect with supportive peers. The guiding slogan was <i>"Team work makes serene work."</i>

### Planning
 Starting with paper proofs, the team delved into conceptualizing the app's structure and design. These paper mockups not only facilitated initial feedback but also laid the groundwork for understanding user interfaces and design principles. Seeking feedback from a friend led to adjustments based on both reactive and reflexive responses. Tabs were refined, features were merged, and customization options were integrated.

### Prototype
The transition from paper to digital occurred in Figma, where realistic mockups for each mobile screen ensured consistency. Features from different versions were incorporated to address feedback concerns, including a redesign of the activity selection screen.

### Production
Coding marked the shift from design to functionality. Responsibilities were divided among team members, with a focus on designing layouts, implementing specific pages, and managing database logic. Collaboration and communication were crucial, with an additional role in project management.

### Leadership in Process
Beyond individual contributions, I took on a leadership role. Serving as a reminder for code repository submissions and orchestrating the integration of separate elements into a coherent program, I delved into project management. The experience taught valuable lessons in planning, coordination, and teamwork.
